# Text Classification using LSTM networks
Course project Introduction to Natural Language Processing. Ranking of a database of reviews into categories from 'very negative' to 'very positive' is performed using LSTM networks. Similarly, a similar process is performed when performing word-for-word tagging of a small percentage of the database. In the latter, a fine-tuning process is carried out by transferring the weights of other models to that of the network. Finally, the result can be visualized.

The notebook is in **spanish**.
